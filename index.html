            <p> Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. 
                Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: 
                a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, 
                a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though,
                 the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what 
                 constitutes a paragraph.</p><br>
